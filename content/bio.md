 Hello, I'm **Francesco** and I'm a grad student of **Data Science** and **AI** at [University of Trieste](https://dssc.units.it/).
 I'm a **NLP** and **Deep Learning** enthusiast and I'm currently working on my master thesis about **Mechanistic Interpretability** of LLMs at [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/).

 Previously, I studied  **Mathematics** at [University of Rome La Sapienza](https://www.mat.uniroma1.it). 

 I'm also a **sailor** and recently I started to learn **climbing**. I grow up in a small town in the [center of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbo), but I'm currently living in Trieste, a beautiful city on the sea in the north-east of Italy.
