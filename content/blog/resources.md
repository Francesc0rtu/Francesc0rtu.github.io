In this page I collect all the resources I found useful during my studies along with blogs and page that I love. I hope they can be useful to you too! 
Under each resource I added a short description of the content and my personal opinion about it.

### Machine Learning blogs
- [**Lil'Log**](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/): a blog about machine learning, math and programming. I love this blog, it's very well written and it covers a lot of topics. I found it very useful to get a general overview of a topic before diving into the details.

### Mechanistic Interpretability
- [**Tutorial on Mechanistic Interpretability**](https://arena-ch1-transformers.streamlit.app/): An *amazing* collection of tutorial/exercise to get started deeply with transformers and Mechanistic Interpretability.


### Transformers random articles
- [Sampling from transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate)

## How to do a PhD
- [Resources to help global equality for PhD in NLP](https://github.com/zhijing-jin/nlp-phd-global-equality): a collection of resources to help global equality for PhD in NLP. I found this collection very useful to get an overview of the resources available to PhD students in NLP. Curated by Zhijing Jin.
- [The Researcher's Bible](https://sweb.inf.ed.ac.uk/bundy/how-tos/resbible.html): a collection of tips and tricks for PhD students.
