In this page I collect all the tools that I found useful to organize my work and increase my productivity. The primary goal of this page is to keep track of the tools I use and to share them with others. I hope they can be useful to you too! 

During my studies I tried a lot of tools and I think that balance the simplicity and the features is the key to a good productivity workflow. Indeed, a lot of very powerful tools are too complex and I found myself spending more time organizing the tools than actually using them and I naturally discard them and went back to unorganized workflow. One example is Notion, which is a very powerful tool, but I found it too complex for my needs and I went back to Google Docs and Google Sheets.

## Mail
Unfortunately, my primary email client is Outlook, with a outdated @live.it email address. That is because I have been using it for years and my standard username is already taken on Gmail. I use the web version of Outlook, which is not the best, but it gets the job done. However, I'm actively looking for a good client compatible with Ubuntu. I tried Thunderbird, but I didn't like too much and I had some issues with the calendar and ther synchronization of the spam folder.

I also have the work email, which is a Office 365 account. I use the web version of Outlook for this account too.

## Calendar
I use Google calendar as my main claendar. I really like the interface and the integration with the Google ecosystem and my Pixel phone. To sync the two outlook calendars with Google calendar I use Zapier free plan. It works really well and it's basically create a new event in Google calendar when a new event is created in Outlook. 

I then use Calendly to schedule meetings with other people. I really like the interface and the integration with Google calendar.

## Todo list
I use Todoist as my main todo list and workflow manager. I use the integration with Google calendar to see the tasks in the calendar. I then add all my to do without organize too much and then I use the priority and the due date to organize them. I have just one way sync with Google calendar, so I can't see the tasks in the calendar, but I can see the events in Todoist. I find this way more useful since a lot of my task are not time sensitive and Todoist is my main app for tasks.
